*NOTEBOOK*

This notebook focuses on using the "Japanese Newspapers 2005-2021" dataset found on Kaggle. The main objective is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the data found in Japanese newspapers. To facilitate collaboration and version control, a shared Git codebase will be created.

Initially, interactive notebooks with selected graphs will be developed to visualize the main features of the dataset. These graphs will help to better understand the distribution of journalistic sources, the period in which the articles were published, the frequency of keywords, and the polarity of sentiments in the texts.

Next, we will focus on training a classifier, whose task will be to predict in which newspaper an article was written, based on the text of the article itself. Evaluation metrics will be calculated to measure the performance of the classifier. A crucial aspect of the project will involve the exploration of different machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques. This approach will allow us to compare the performance of various models and identify the best approach for our specific problem.
